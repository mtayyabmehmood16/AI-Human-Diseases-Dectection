# Project One-Pager: AI Vital System

## **Vision**
To replace outdated paper medical records with a secure, **AI-driven web platform** that monitors patient health in real-time.

---

## **🌟 Core Modules**

### **1. AI & Diagnostics**
*   **The "Doctor's Co-Pilot":** An integrated AI engine (Gemini) that reviews symptoms and suggests potential diagnoses.
*   **Risk Calculator:** Automatically estimates the probability of chronic diseases (Heart Health, Diabetes) based on patient history.

### **2. Contactless Vitals (The "Wow" Factor)**
*   **Webcam Heart Monitor:** Uses advanced computer vision to detect heartbeats and stress levels from a video feed of the patient's face.
*   **No Wearables Needed:** Accurately measures BPM and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) using just a laptop camera.

### **3. Next-Gen Security**
*   **FaceID for Healthcare:** Patients and staff can log in or pull up records instantly using Facial Recognition.
*   **Secure & Private:** Data is encrypted and access is strictly role-based.
